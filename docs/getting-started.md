# Getting Started with EVM CTF Challenges

This repository contains Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges focused on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) security vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Foundry installed (see README.md)
- Basic knowledge of Solidity

## Running Challenges

1. Navigate to a challenge directory, e.g., `cd challenges/01-Reentrancy`
2. Run tests: `forge test`
3. Solve the challenge by exploiting the vulnerability

## Structure

- `src/`: Contract source files
- `test/`: Test files
- `README.md`: Challenge description

Happy hacking!
